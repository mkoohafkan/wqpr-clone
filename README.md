# Water Quality Portal Retrieve (Clone)

Retrieve environmental sensor data from the California State
Department of Water Resources, Division of Environmental Services 
Water Quality Portal via the TelemetryDirect Web Services API. 

This is a clone of a package I developed while working for the
California Department of Water Resources. Sensitive information
and development history have been removed but I have kept the
underlying infrastructure as a learning tool/reference/example.
**This package is not functional** because proprietary information
has been removed. Maybe someday I'll make a mock server so that this
package can function as a demo... someday...
